## Digit Classification Using MLP (Scikit-learn)

This script demonstrates a complete, clean, and principled pipeline for:

- Loading the sklearn digits dataset
- Proper preprocessing and normalization
- Training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier
- Evaluating the model using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Predicting a digit from an external image

The implementation is designed to be educational, reproducible,
and scientifically defensible.
